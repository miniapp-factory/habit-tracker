```
Build a single-page mobile-friendly mini-app called Two-Pill Habit (Minimal).

Show two large “pill” choices side-by-side (stack on narrow screens). Each pill contains a short habit (text + emoji) and a short reward line.

A Random button generates two different random habits (from a small built-in list).

User taps one pill to commit; the selected pill is highlighted and a Done button appears.

When Done is tapped show a success message and display the reward (no persistence, no history). Optionally show a tiny confetti emoji/animation.

No localStorage, no server, no settings, no footer. Keep everything in memory for the current session only.

Mobile-first layout, simple modern styling, accessible large buttons.

Tech: single HTML file with plain JS (or React if preferred), tiny and readable.

Sample habit pool (use these as seeds):
["10 push-ups 💪", "5-minute walk 🚶", "Drink 2 glasses of water 💧", "Read 5 pages 📘", "15 squats 🦵", "Cook a healthy snack 🍲", "5-minute stretch 🧘", "Write one sentence ✍️"]

Sample reward styles (display-only):

“Reward: Reduce next push-up set by 2”

“Reward: +1 Treat Token (just shown)”

“Reward: 5-min break (you earned it)”
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I can update the metadata and create the logo description file.  
Please add the following file to the chat so I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once that file is added, I’ll supply the changes for both `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and the new logo file.

#### apply changes  

I need the current contents of the two files that will be changed:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`

Please add those files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
