+Code the following app
+```
+Build a single-page mobile-friendly mini-app called Two-Pill Habit (Minimal).
+
+Show two large “pill” choices side-by-side (stack on narrow screens). Each pill contains a short habit (text + emoji) and a short reward line.
+
+A Random button generates two different random habits (from a small built-in list).
+
+User taps one pill to commit; the selected pill is highlighted and a Done button appears.
+
+When Done is tapped show a success message and display the reward (no persistence, no history). Optionally show a tiny confetti emoji/animation.
+
+No localStorage, no server, no settings, no footer. Keep everything in memory for the current session only.
+
+Mobile-first layout, simple modern styling, accessible large buttons.
+
+Tech: single HTML file with plain JS (or React if preferred), tiny and readable.
+
+Sample habit pool (use these as seeds):
+["10 push-ups 💪", "5-minute walk 🚶", "Drink 2 glasses of water 💧", "Read 5 pages 📘", "15 squats 🦵", "Cook a healthy snack 🍲", "5-minute stretch 🧘", "Write one sentence ✍️"]
+
+Sample reward styles (display-only):
+
+“Reward: Reduce next push-up set by 2”
+
+“Reward: +1 Treat Token (just shown)”
+
+“Reward: 5-min break (you earned it)”
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
